## My name is Harrison Weisberg & I'm a Full Stack Engineer from Marina del Rey CA. 
### I'm currently completing a full time immersive Software Engineering bootcamp with General Assembly. 

While I may be new to coding, my love an experience in the tech field has been a part of my life as far as I can remember. I'm thrilled to be able to contribute to the world of tech in new and exciting ways!
